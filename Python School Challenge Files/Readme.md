Programming language(s) used - Python  
Purpose of code (main functionality) - Lots of different files with implementations of algorithms used during school challenges I took part in (National Cipher Challenge, Ritangle, Bebras, etc), as well as random algorithms that I wanted to implement  
Scale of project (number of classes / functions / lines of code) - N/a
Use of object-oriented concepts (this is not necessary, but useful) - N/a
Use of data structures - N/a
Any interesting use of data structures / implementations of algorithms - Basic OOP binary tree implemented, luhn algorithm, affine cipher, transposition cipher, vigenere cipher, etc
